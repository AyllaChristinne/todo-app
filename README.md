## My process

### Built with

- [Angular 17.0.3](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Angular CDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cdk)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### What I learned
With this project, I was able to reinforce concepts of Angular and its environment. Furthermore, for the first time I used Angular CDK, and got to know and use the UUID package.
